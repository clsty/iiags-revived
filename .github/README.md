illogical impulse on AGSv1 Revived

**NOTE: This project is WIP. Please do not use.**

## Description

This project used to be a modified version of [illogical-impulse on AGSv1](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland/tree/ii-ags), in short `ii-ags` (the old version of this project is now at the branch `hyprarch`). Although the upstream has been deprecated in favor of `ii-qs` (`qs` means Quickshell), `ii-ags` may still be usable. Considering that `ii-qs` is not suitable for low-power devices like Surface GO 1 as tested by clsty, the project aims to revive `ii-ags`.
